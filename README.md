Analyzing NYC Citi Bike data with Tableau

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to understand the NYC Citi Bike system to determine the viability of a similar bikeshare business in Des Moines, Iowa. Data was obtained through https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data and analysis was conducted on August 2019 trip data. I ran different analyses on users by gender and subscriber status, trip duration and location, and timing of trips.

## Results

### User Analysis
Most Citi Bike users are Male.

Subscribers account for over 3/4 of total rides. Males also account for nearly 3/4 of rides. 
Guest customers are more likely to not list their gender.

### Trip Analysis
Nearly all trips are under 1 hour, with most under 20 minutes

Weekday trips are concentrated during rush hors and weekend trips are spread throughout the day

Gender does not seem to affect trip timing as much as trip volume.

Trips are concentrated in Manhattan (New York County), especially south of Central Park, which is the densest area of New York. Brooklyn (Kings County) also sees some trip density in its most populated neighborhoods

### Additional Considerations
New York City is one of the top tourist destinations in the world - Des Moines is not. Therefore, it is important to better understand the affect of tourism on the Citi Bike data so we can adapt our strategy to serve a customer base with different needs. 

Guest trips are concentrated on weekends

Subscriber trips are concentrated on weekdays, but there is considerable weekend volume
