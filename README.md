Analyzing NYC Citi Bike data with Tableau

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to understand the NYC Citi Bike system to determine the viability of a similar bikeshare business in Des Moines, Iowa. Data was obtained through https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data and analysis was conducted on August 2019 trip data. I ran different analyses on users by gender and subscriber status, trip duration and location, and timing of trips.
